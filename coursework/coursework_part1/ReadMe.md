### Course work

Using your PhD research data, protocol, code, etc, write a report explaining from where you start, which measures are already in place to increase reproducibility as per concepts presented during days 1 and 2. What measures can be taken to increase reproducibility and if any, why some cannot be implemented? (page count 2 to 3)

Submit your coursework by September 15th either via e-mail to Cyril and Melanie or by making a PR to the repo and adding it to the ReproducibleQuantitativeDataScience\coursework\coursework_part1 folder.
