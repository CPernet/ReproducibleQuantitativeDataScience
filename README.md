# ReproducibleQuantitativeDataScience

The course structure is over 5 days plus personal work: 2 days, course work, 2 days, course work, and 1 day with presentations.  

We expect students to join the course several months after starting their PhD allowing them to already have data and some code. This will allow applying the concepts developed to their own data and code. 

## Part 1

### Day 1 - Data Collection and data storage

- Introduction to reproducibility: Definitions and origins (1h) Reproducibility is hard: issues (1 h)
- Data provenance: keeping track of where data are coming from - lecture and exercises (1h)
- How do you store data on your computer? Data structures and data naming - lecture and exercises (1h)
- Ethic and GDPR - lecture and practical case reviews (2h)

### Day 2 - Reproducible designs, protocols and pre-registration

- Concepts and tools for protocol documentation, and study pre-registration - lecture (1.5h)
- Case studies - exercise (1h)
- Using markdown for documentation - practical (1/2h)
- Version control and social coding with Git and GitHub - practical (3h) 

### Course work

Using your PhD research data, protocol, code, etc, write a report explaining from where you start, which measures are already in place to increase reproducibility as per concepts presented during days 1 and 2. What measures can be taken to increase reproducibility and if any, why some cannot be implemented? (min page count 3)

## Part 2

### Day 3 - Better coding 

- Literate programming - lecture and exercises (1h)
- Good coding practices - lecture and exercises (2h)
- Time to update your code - practical from student's own analysis scripts (3h)

### Day 4 - Better analyses 

- P-hacking your data - lecture (1h)
- Encapsulate code for reproducibility using containers (2h)
- An introduction to computational analysis methods: permutation, bootstrap, cross-validation, out-of-sample generalization - lecture and exercises (3hours)

### Course work 

Make a copy of an existing code you have used and/o used in the lab and improve it’s reproducibilty using any of the tools reviewed during the course: from better inline documentation and variable coding to updated analyses.

Make a 10 minutes presentation summarizing all of your course works and what measures you have taken to improve reproducibility in your PhD. 

## Part 3

### Day 5 - Data sharing 

- The ‘data’ cycle, sharing from raw data to figures - lecture (1h)
- Reproducible publishing - a case study (1h)
- Presentations and discussions/social event (drinks and pizza 4h)
