# ReproducibleQuantitativeDataScience

A course prepared by Dr Melanie Ganz and Dr Cyril Pernet, with amazing guests: Dr Robert Ostenveld (RO), Dr Michael Hanke (MH) and Dr Nikola Stikov (NS).
The course structure is over 5 days plus personal work: 2 days, course work, 2 days, course work, and 1 day with presentations.

**For teachers**: We expect students to join the course several months after starting their PhD allowing them to already have data and some code. This will allow them to apply the concepts developed to their own data and code. It is also expected to have a platform to interact with students via a 'wall' with notes. 

**For students**: During the course, active participation is expected. In session 1, we'll use [padlet](https://padlet.com/dashboard) to interact with each other (anonymous posting allowed) and also do group work. In session 2, we use GitHub (that you learn in session 1) to share code and review each other code. It is recommended to share something you are working on, but if you feel uncomfortable with that, prepare something to be shared/reviewed. In session 3, you must present in front of everybody. While it may feel uncomfortable, it is expected from any PhD student to be able to do so, and not just for this course. In general, there are no rights and wrongs in trying to improve reproducibility, it is only expected that you try given the conceptual and practical tools presented.

## Part 1

### Day 2 - Reproducible designs, protocols and pre-registration

- [Using markdown](https://github.com/CPernet/ReproducibleQuantitativeDataScience/blob/main/lecture_slides/1.07_Using_markdown_for_documentation.pdf) see [cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for documentation - practical (MG)
- [Version control and social coding with Git](https://github.com/CPernet/ReproducibleQuantitativeDataScience/blob/main/lecture_slides/1.08_VersionControl_Mkd_SocialCoding.pdf) see the [quick sheet](https://github.com/CPernet/Quicksheets/blob/main/git_github/git.mkd) and GitHub - practical, split into novice/advanced groups (all) 

### Course work

Using your PhD research data, protocol, code, etc, write a report explaining from where you start, and which measures are already in place to increase reproducibility as per concepts presented during days 1 and 2. What measures can be taken to increase reproducibility and if any, why some cannot be implemented? (page count 2 to 3)

Submit your coursework via e-mail to Cyril and Melanie.

## Part 2

### Day 3 - Better coding 

- [Programming](https://github.com/CPernet/ReproducibleQuantitativeDataScience/blob/main/lecture_slides/2.01_Programming.pdf) (CP)
- [Good coding practices](https://github.com/CPernet/ReproducibleQuantitativeDataScience/blob/main/lecture_slides/2.02_Better_coding.pdf) (CP) 
- [An introduction to computational analysis methods](https://github.com/CPernet/ReproducibleQuantitativeDataScience/blob/main/lecture_slides/2.03_Computational_analysis_methods.pdf): permutation, bootstrap, cross-validation, out-of-sample generalization (MG)
- Time to update your code - push code here, review each other work, present, discuss with teachers (MG & CP)

### Day 4 - Better analyses 

- [P-hacking](https://github.com/CPernet/ReproducibleQuantitativeDataScience/blob/main/lecture_slides/2.04_Hacking_HARKing_and_SHARKING_your_research.pdf) your data (CP)
- Understanding p-values (see [notebook](https://github.com/CPernet/ReproducibleQuantitativeDataScience/tree/main/p_values))
- Feedback on coursework and discuss further issues to make your PhD reproducible (MG, CP)
- [Computational reproducibility](https://files.inm7.de/mih/pres/talks/rdm_reproducibility_copenhagen2023.html) (lecture and practical all afternoon - MH). 

Please prepare before the course:
  - [install docker on your own machine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) so you can use a container and then build a container.
  - We will reproduce a full paper, to safe download time during the practical, please download the two files at https://datapub.fz-juelich.de/studyforrest/remodnav/docker-layers beforehand
  - [install DataLad on your own machine](https://handbook.datalad.org/r?install) to be able to execute all steps to reproduce the paper, and to be able to make your own reproducible in the same way

### Course work 

Improve code you are using based on the concepts and tools reviewed over the 4 days: from version control and better inline documentation, to functionalization and modern computational statistics.  
Make a 10 minutes presentation summarizing all of your course works and what measures you have taken to improve reproducibility in your PhD (including work from session 1). 

## Part 3

### Day 5 - Data sharing 

- The ‘data’ cycle, [sharing from raw data to figures](https://github.com/CPernet/ReproducibleQuantitativeDataScience/blob/main/lecture_slides/3.01_DataSharing.pdf) - lecture (1h, CP, MG)
- [Reproducible publishing](https://github.com/CPernet/ReproducibleQuantitativeDataScience/blob/main/lecture_slides/3.02_OpenPublishing.pdf) - [see example here](https://preprint.neurolibre.org/10.55458/neurolibre.00014/) (1.30h, NS)
- Presentations and discussions/social event (drinks and pizza 4h)
