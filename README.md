# ReproducibleQuantitativeDataScience

The course structure is over 5 days plus personal work: 2 days, course work, 2 days, course work, and 1 day with presentations.  

We expect students to join the course several months after starting their PhD allowing them to already have data and some code. This will allow applying the concepts developed to their own data and code. 

We'll use [padlet](https://padlet.com/dashboard) to interact with each other 

## Part 1

### Day 1 - Data Collection and data storage

- Introduction to reproducibility: Definitions and origins (CP) 
- How do you store data on your computer? Data structures and data naming (RO)
- Data provenance: keeping track of where data are coming from (MG)
- Reproducibility is hard: [case studies](http://www.practicereproducibleresearch.org/core-chapters/4-casestudies.html) (all)

### Day 2 - Reproducible designs, protocols and pre-registration

- Concepts and tools for protocol documentation, and study pre-registration (CP)
- Ethic and GDPR - lecture and practical case reviews (CP & RO)
- Using markdown ([cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) for documentation - practical (MG)
- Version control and social coding with Git ([quick sheet](https://github.com/CPernet/Quicksheets/blob/main/git_github/git.mkd)) and GitHub - practical, split into novice/advanced groups (all) 

### Course work

Using your PhD research data, protocol, code, etc, write a report explaining from where you start, which measures are already in place to increase reproducibility as per concepts presented during days 1 and 2. What measures can be taken to increase reproducibility and if any, why some cannot be implemented? (page count 2 to 3)

Submit your coursework by September 15th either via e-mail to Cyril and Melanie or by making a PR to the repo and adding it to the [coursework_part1 folder](https://github.com/CPernet/ReproducibleQuantitativeDataScience/tree/main/coursework/coursework_part1).

## Part 2

### Day 3 - Better coding 

- Programming (CP)
- Good coding practices (CP) 
- An introduction to computational analysis methods: permutation, bootstrap, cross-validation, out-of-sample generalization (MG)
- Time to update your code - update your own scripts and functions, work in teams and with teachers, review each other work (MG & CP)

### Day 4 - Better analyses 

- P-hacking your data - lecture (CP)
- Understanding p-values (see [notebook](https://github.com/CPernet/ReproducibleQuantitativeDataScience/tree/main/p_values))
- Feedback on coursework and discuss further issue to make your PhD reproducible (MG, MH, CP)
- Computational reproducibility (lecture and practical all afternoon -- Michael Hanke -- lecture slides @https://files.inm7.de/mih/pres/talks/rdm_reproducibility_copenhagen2023.html#). 

Please prepare before the course:
  - [install docker on your own machine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) so you can use a container and then build a container.
  - We will reproduce a full paper, to safe download time during the practical, please download the two files at https://datapub.fz-juelich.de/studyforrest/remodnav/docker-layers beforehand
  - [install DataLad on your own machine](https://handbook.datalad.org/r?install) to be able to execute all steps to reproduce the paper, and to be able to make your own reproducible in the same way

### Course work 

Improve code you are using based on the concepts and tools reviewed over the 4 days: from version control and better inline documentation, to functionalization and modern computational statistics.
Make a 10 minutes presentation summarizing all of your course works and what measures you have taken to improve reproducibility in your PhD. 

## Part 3

### Day 5 - Data sharing 

- The ‘data’ cycle, sharing from raw data to figures - lecture (1h)
- Reproducible publishing - a case study (1h)
- Presentations and discussions/social event (drinks and pizza 4h)
