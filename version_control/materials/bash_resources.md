# Bash resources

If you open a terminal on Windows, Linux or macOS, you are greeted by a command prompt and you can type commands to interact with the computer. Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is one of the most widely used shells and is the default on Linux and macOS.

As the Git command-line application has many options that are well documented online, it is often useful and sometimes needed to go to the Bash terminal to interact with Git.  

You can use Bash to navigate through your filesystem, do simple operations on your files (like copying and renaming), use git pull, push and commit. You can also write complete bash scripts that can even have graphical user interfaces using [bsc](https://bashsimplecurses.readthedocs.io/en/master/), [dialog](https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_adv_dialog.php) or [whiptail](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bash_Shell_Scripting/Whiptail).

On Windows you can get the same command-line experience with [Git bash](https://gitforwindows.org).
