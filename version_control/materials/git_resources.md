# Where to go from here...

You have now set-up your basic git version control ingredients: Downloaded git, created a GitHub account and collected your first hands-on experiences with the basic git commands. But this is only the beginning. A couple of important git features that we have not covered during the workshop are [branching](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches), forking & pull-requests (but checkout [this step-by-step instruction](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)) and how to un-do things (see section troubleshooting below).

In this document we have listed some helpful resources for you to go beyond the basic recipe and become a real Git "connaisseur":
